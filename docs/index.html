Newaz, J. Piland, and T. Milenković (2021), under review.</p>

<h1><a class="nav-anchor" id="secm2-1" href="#secm2-1">II. Installation</a></h1><p>Our software can be run in three different modes: 1) Mode 1 to just create multi-layer sequentials, 2) Mode 2 to create multi-layer sequentials and extract dynamic graphlet features from multi-layer sequentials, and 3) Mode 3 to create multi-layer sequentials, extract dynamic graphlet features of multi-layer sequentials, and perform protein structural classification. <strong>Our software has been tested on Ubuntu-based Linux systems.</strong> </p>

<p><strong> Mode 1. </strong>To be able to perform Mode 1, the user needs to install <a href="https://www.r-project.org/"> R version 3.4.4 </a> or higher (on an ubuntu-based linux system, this can be done by writing <code>sudo apt install r-base</code> on the command terminal), along with the following R packages: 'shiny' (version 1.6.0 has been tested), 'shinyjs' (version 2.0.0 has been tested), 'tools' (version 3.4.4 has been tested), 'data.table' (version 1.13.6 has been tested), 'stringr' (version 1.4.0 has been tested), and 'igraph' (version 1.2.6 has been tested). To install these packages, follow these steps. Run R in the command terminal. Then, to install the 'data.table' package for example, write <code>install.packages('data.table')</code>  and follow the instructions.</p>

<p><strong> Mode 2. </strong>To be able to perform Mode 2, the user first needs to perform software installation steps for Mode 1. Then, the user needs to compile the "dcount.cpp" code present in the 'src' folder, and place the compiled output named 'dcount' in the 'bin' folder (to use already compiled code, copy and paste 'dcount' from 'bin/precompiled' folder to the 'bin' folder). On an Ubuntu-based linux system, you can compile the code by going to the 'src' folder from your command terminal and writing <code>g++ dcount.cpp -O3 -o dcount</code>. </p>

<p><strong> Mode 3. </strong>To be able to perform Mode 3, the user first needs to perform software installation steps for Mode 1 and Mode 2. Then, the user needs to install <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/"> python </a> (versions 2.7.18, 2.7.5, and 3.8.3 have been tested), along with the following python packages: 'numpy' (versions 1.13.3 and 1.16.6 have been tested), 'pandas' (verion 0.22.0 has been tested), and 'sklearn' (versions 0.20.1 and 0.23.1 have been tested). For an Ubuntu-based linux system, we recommend to install these packages using <a href="https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/"> conda </a>. Once conda is installed, the python packages can be installed by running <code> conda install numpy </code>, <code>  conda install -c anaconda pandas </code>, and <code>  conda install -c anaconda scikit-learn </code> on the command terminal. </p>




<h1><a class="nav-anchor" id="secm3-1" href="#secm3-1">III. Running the software</a></h1>

<p>The software can be run either on a command-line terminal or as a graphical user interfact (GUI) application.</p>

<p><strong>As a GUI application:</strong> after starting a command-line terminal, our software can be run by navigating to its base directory and running the single command <code>Rscript gui.R</code>.</p>

<p><strong>As a command-line application:</strong> after starting a command-line terminal, our software can be run by navigating to its base directory and running the following <code>Rscript ./scripts/cmdrun.r [Distance cutoff] [Number of amino acids] [Choice of task] [Path to annotation file] [Path to directory containing CIF files] [Indicator for partitions] [Path to partitions]</code>. These seven parameters are explained below.</p>

<!-- <p>Note: no matter whether you are running MUSEQ on a command-line or as a GUI application, make sure that the path to the 'bin' folder of R and the 'bin' folder of python is set. 
	For Windows, this can be done by navigating to Control Panel -> System -> Environment Variables in your computer, and adding the path to R and python "bin" folders to the "path" variable.
</p> -->

<p>There are seven parameters that needs to be set before running the software, which are as follows.</p>

<p><strong>Distance cutoff:</strong> To make a PSN, amino acids are taken as nodes and any two amino acids that are close enough are connected by an edge. The 'distance cutoff' parameter defines the largest 3-dimensional (3D) distance (in Angstroms) between any two amino acids in a protein domain to be considered as close enough. The application currently has seven different values to choose from, i.e., 4,5,6,...,10. In the original study, the value of 6 was used.</p>

<p><strong>Number of amino acids:</strong> A multi-layer sequential protein structure network (PSN) consists of two or more static PSN snapshots.
			The 'number of amino acids' parameter defines the number of amino acids that are added
		at each static protein structure network (PSN) snapshot, as the multi-layer sequential is being created.
			In more detail, given a value 'X' for the 'number of amino acids' parameter, a multi-layer sequential is created as follows. Starting from the begining of a given protein sequence (i.e., the first amino acid towards the N-terminal 
			of the protein), first X number of amino acids are converted into the first static PSN snapshot, then first 2X number of amino acids are converted into the second static PSN snapshot, then first 3X number of amino acids are converted into the thrid static PSN snapshot, and so on until all of the amino acids in the sequence are captured in the last snapshot of the corresponding multi-layer sequential. In the original study, a value of 5 was used. In the application 16 different the values (5,6,7,...,20) can be used.</p>

<p><strong>Choice of task:</strong> This parameter controls the extent of the application that the user wants to run.
			There are three options: Mode 1, Mode 2, and Mode 3.
			If a user wants to just create dynamic networks, then the option 'Mode 1' should be chosen.
			If a user wants to create dynamic networks and also extract dynamic graphlet-based features of the dynamic networks, then the option 'Mode 2' should be chosen.
			If a user wants to create dynamic networks, extract dynamic graphlet-based features of the dynamic networks, and classify the protein domains using the resulting dynamic features,
			 then the option 'Mode 3' should be chosen.</p>

<p><strong>Path to annotation file:</strong> This is a path to the file with a list of protein domains to be processed. The file should have a '.txt' extension.
			The contents of the file should be in a two column format, with the two columns being separated by a 'tab'.
			The first column should be the structual class of the corresponding protein domain in the second column. 
			This structural class information is only used in the protein structural classification part of the software. 
			If you do not have structural class information of the proteins in your dataset and if you do not wish to perform 
			protein structural classification, then please add a dummy structural class for each of the proteins in your list.
			In the second column, the name of the protein domain should be given as 'CIFID_chainID_startID1_endID1+startID2_endID2+...+startIDn_endIDn'. 
			Here, CIFID is the name of the Cyrstallographic Information File (CIF) file. For example, for the CIF file '1fnn.cif' the CIFID is '1fnn'.
			chainID is the idenfication of the protein chain to which the corresponding protein domain belongs. startIDs and ednIDs represent the starting and ending sequence number for each of the contiguous amino acid sequence segments of the corresponding protein domain. For example, if a protein domain has two segments that form that domain, then startID1 will represent the sequence number of the chainID where the corresponding first segment starts, and endID1 will represent the sequence number of the chainID where the corresponding first segment ends. Additionally, startID2 will represent the sequence number of the chainID where the corresponding second segment starts, and endID2 will represent the sequence number of the chainID where the corresponding second segment ends.
			For example, sequence number 1 to 17 in the chain A of the CIF file '1fnn.cif' belongs to the segment 1 and 
			sequence number 192 to 275 in the chain A of the CIF file '1fnn.cif' belongs to the segment 2 of the same protein domain protein that belongs to the structural class of 'alpha'. 
			In this case, the corresponsing line in the annotation file should be 'alpha	[tab separation] 1fnn_A_1_17+192_275'. As another example, sequence number 2 to 54 in the chain A of the CIF file '1aip.pdb' belongs to the segment 1, which is the only segment of contiugous amino acids of the protein domain that belongs to the structural class of 'alpha'. In this case, the corresponsing line in the annotation file should be 'alpha	[tab separation] 1aip_C_2_54'.
			If the protein domain you want to process spans the whole protein chain, then please write the first sequence number of the chain as startID and the last sequence number of the chain as the endID.</p>

<p><strong>Path to CIF folder:</strong> This is a path to the directory where all of the CIFs of the protein 3-dimensional structures are stored in your local computing machine. </p>

<p><strong>Indicator for partitions:</strong> This takes in the value of either 0 or 1. The value of 0 indicates that the user will not provide partitions of the data in the annotation file that are required to perform 5-fold cross validation in the classification task. In this case, the software will generate its own partition set from the data in the annotation file. The value of 1 indicates that the user will provide partitions of the data in the annotation file, in order for the software to perform the 5-fold cross validation in the classification task. In this case, a user has to create the partitions in a defined format. This format can be obtained by first running the software with no external partitions, i.e., using a value of 0 for this parameter, and then looking at the output folder named "partitions". Note that this parameter is only present when a user runs the software in the commandline. For the GUI option, the value for this parameter is always set as 0.</p>

<p><strong>Path to partitions:</strong> This is a path to the directory where the user-defined partitions are present. Note that, a value for this parameter is only needed when a user sets the value for "Indicator for partitions" as 1. If a user sets the value for "Indicator for partitions" as 0, then there is no need to provide any value for "Path to partitions".  Note that this parameter is only present when a user runs the software in the commandline. </p>
