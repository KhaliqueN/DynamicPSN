# DynamicPSN


See documentation in docs/index.html


Folder structure:

bin/ contains the dcount file that is used to compute dynamic graphlet degree vector matrix

docs/ contains documentation for DynaP (docs/index.html contains the main documentation file)

examples/ contains example files

pdb-directory/ contains all of the Protein Data Bank (PDB) that you use

scripts/ contains R/python scripts used

src/ contains the source file, dcount.cpp, which computes dynamic graphlet degree vector matrix

vectorfiles/ contains helper files for the dynamic graphlets program

====

This folder contains the original implementation of DynaP by Khalique Newaz, 2021. This folder is part of the publication "Dynamic network analysis improves protein structural classification", Khalique Newaz, Jacob Piland, and Tijana Milenkovic (2021), under review.
